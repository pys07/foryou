<h1 align="center"> ♥ ForYou ♥ – Safety Made Simple </h1>

ForYou is an Android application designed to keep you and your loved ones safe.
In moments of danger, the app sends your **real-time location** to your emergency contacts. However, that’s not all — it also empowers communities to share experiences anonymously, warn others, and stay aware of what’s happening around them.

Think of it as your **pocket guardian angel** 🪽— with data, alerts, and a safety network at your fingertips.
